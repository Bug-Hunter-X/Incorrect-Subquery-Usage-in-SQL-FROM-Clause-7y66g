The following SQL query attempts to use a subquery in the FROM clause to retrieve data from multiple tables, but it fails due to an incorrect syntax and ambiguous referencing.

```sql
SELECT T1.column1, T2.column2
FROM (SELECT column1 FROM table1) AS T1,
     (SELECT column2 FROM table2) AS T2
WHERE T1.column1 = T2.column2;
```

The problem is that the subqueries in the FROM clause lack a proper JOIN condition, which is essential when retrieving data from multiple tables. This results in a Cartesian product, where each row from T1 is combined with each row from T2, causing an inflated result set and inefficient processing.
