# Incorrect Subquery Usage in SQL FROM Clause

This repository demonstrates a common error in SQL involving the incorrect usage of subqueries in the FROM clause. The provided SQL query attempts to retrieve data from multiple tables using subqueries, but it fails due to missing JOIN conditions, leading to a Cartesian product instead of the intended join operation.

The solution demonstrates the correct way to use subqueries with JOIN conditions to perform the desired data retrieval efficiently.  This example shows how to avoid incorrect results and maintain query performance.
